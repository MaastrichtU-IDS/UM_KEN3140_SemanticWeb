    "### 1. Background\n",
    "#### A. RDF recap \n",
    "As we saw in Lectures 2 and 3 in the course, the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) provides a way to capture information about a domain of interest as sets of statements called \"triples\", each of which is composed of three parts: [a subject, predicate and object](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#data-model).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that subjects, predicates and objects are denoted by [Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987). One of the main reasons for using IRIs is to make it easier to assign **globally unique** names for the entities so we can eliminate the possibility of another resource somewhere on the Web using the same name, causing confusion as to which entity the identifer refers to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason is of course related to the [Linked Data paradigm](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData)! Hopefully, [HTTP](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/#rfc723x) IRIs are used so that there can eventually be webpages published at these IRIs to describe information about the associated entity with links to other related entities on the Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. RDF Schema recap\n",
    "We recall that with RDF we can represent relationships between \"things\" (also called instances and objects). For example, in RDF I can state that \"John is married to Mary\". One possible triple representation of this could be \n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://somenamespace.com/john> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse> <http://somenamespace.com/mary>``.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does a machine know what \"john\" and \"mary\" are? Suppose we know that John is a chef and Mary is an Engineer. We can state that with these triples in RDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://somenamespace.com/john> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Chef>``.\n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://somenamespace.com/mary> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Engineer>``.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem obvious to us that chefs and engineers are people, a machine does not find this obvious. Inferring that Mary and John are people would enable the machine to make other inferences which may be helpful. Therefore, we need a way to state this in RDF. We can of course add new triples to the graph (analogous to the ones above) to state that John and Mary are persons. However, this approach leaves out the expression of how the types \"chef\" and \"engineer\" relate to the type \"person\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### i. rdfs:subClassOf\n",
    "The good news is that RDF Schema extends RDF to provide a relation called [rdfs:subClassOf](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) which allows us to state that some types are subclasses of other types. Of course, you could have created your own new custom relation to state subclass relations, however this approach will not define the **machine-interpretable meaning** of the relation. RDFS, on the other hand, [defines its types and relations mathematically](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example about John and Mary, we could add the following RDFS triples to our graph to solve the problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Chef> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person>``.\n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Engineer> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person>``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, these statements mean that \"every instance of the Chef type is also an instance of the Person type\" and \"every instance of the Engineer type is also an instance of the Person type\", respectively. It is not required for this course to understand the semantics of RDFS in full technical detail. However, it is important to grasp the intuition behind the semantics and to know that RDFS statements are not just \"rules\" as you would find in logic programming formalisms such as [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). **Side note:** the semantics for RDFS as well as for [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) are [model-theoretic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/) (we will touch upon this in the course when we get to OWL).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ii. rdfs:subPropertyOf\n",
    "\n",
    "[rdfs:subPropertyOf](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) is a similar property to rdfs:subClassOf, but for **predicates**. The intuition is to capture knowledge such as: \"if a person x is married to a person y\" then it should also be the case that \"x knows y\". This can be represented with the RDFS triple: \n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subPropertyOf> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_knows>``\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the other direction is not necessarily true (i.e. if \"x knows y\" it does not mean that \"x is married to y\") so we do **not** add another triple to state that [foaf:knows](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_knows) [rdfs:subPropertyOf](https://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subPropertyOf) [dbo:spouse](http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse). \n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to state sub-properties is useful in RDFS because it enables the reasoner to infer useful implicit information. E.g. if I have a triple which says that \n",
    "\n",
    "##### iii. rdfs:domain & rdfs:range\n",
    "\n",
    "[rdfs:domain](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) is a property that you can assign to a predicate in RDFS. Given a predicate, say p, the domain of p is a **type** which each **subject** must belong to in each triple for which p is the predicate. For example, consider a predicate \"employs\" which intuitively captures the relation of some entity employing another. That is, some entity that pays another to work for them. In this case, the domain of the \"employs\" predicate should arguably be some type of organisation. That is, we want to say that only organisations can employ things. An example of how this can be done with RDFS is (we make use of Schema.org vocabulary):\n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://schema.org/employee> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#domain> <http://schema.org/Organization>``\n",
    "\n",
    "[rdfs:range](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) is to **objects** of triples what [rdfs:domain](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) is to **subjects** of triples. It is a property you can assign to RDF/RDFS predicates that constrain the types of **objects** in triples. Using the \"employs\" relation above as an example, the range of this relation should arguably be persons. I.e., by adding the following triple we constrain the \"employs\" relation to only be able to end in instances of type person:\n",
    "\n",
    "``<http://schema.org/employee> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range> <http://schema.org/Person>``\n",
    "\n",
    "Both domain and range constrains together enforce in our graph that whenever x employs y occurs, x must be of type Organization and y must be of type Person. Can you think of examples which violate these constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### iv. rdfs:label, rdfs:comment\n",
    "[rdfs:label](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_label) and [rdfs:comment](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_comment) are non-semantic predicates included in RDFS to annotate entities in the graph. rdfs:label allows one to assign a human-readable name (label) to a resource. rdfs:comment enables one to attach a piece of text to a resource which either describes what the resource is or describes some important relevant information about it. rdfs:label values are generally shorter pieces of text, and rdfs:comment values are usually longer textual descriptions. Look at the [spouse resource page](http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse) on [DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/about) to see an example of the usage and distinction between these two predicates. "
