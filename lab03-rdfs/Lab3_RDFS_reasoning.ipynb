    "#### Learning objectives:\n",
    "1. Be able to identify which knowledge representation features are not included in [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) and are new to its extension: [RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)\n",
    "2. Be able to identify and add suitable [domain](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain), [range](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) and [subclass](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) relations to an RDF graph to capture more detailed meaning for the entities in the graph\n",
    "3. Be able to apply RDFS reasoning services to an RDF graph to compute implicit inferences about the graph which are not explicitly indicated"

In the text editor of your choice or in the Jupyter Lab environment, open and study the RDF graph located in this file. The graph is represented in Turtle syntax. Notice that in Turtle syntax comments are preceded by the ``#`` character so everything after this character on a particular line is ignored by RDF parsers like Jena. You will also notice there are two sections marked ``Schema section`` and ``Data section`` respectively. The triples under the section titled ``Schema section`` are currently all commented out."

    "### FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Are there tools to visualise an RDF graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. There are many proprietary and free tools for RDF graph management that have visualisation features e.g. [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/) and [Allegrograph](https://allegrograph.com/). However, real-world RDF graphs tend to be extremely large (with millions and sometimes billions of entities). Therefore, it is often not practical to visualise an entire RDF graph but rather smaller subsets or specialised \"views\" of this graph which is what these tools focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **small** graphs, a very quick to use tool is called RDF-grapher and can be located on this page: [http://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher](http://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher). You can copy and paste your Turtle representation into the textbox and click on the ``Visualize`` button. This service is mentioned here just out of interest. You will not be examined about this tool in the course. If it does not work, that's okay - it is not required for the course that it does. We are not going to provide support on how to make it work. [RDF-grapher](http://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher) does not produce the prettiest visualisation but is generally reliable for producing functional visualisations for small RDF graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Is RDFS reasoning rule-based?\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, no. However, in practice, the specific software implementations of RDFS reasoning may employ rule-based algorithms. However, theoretically, RDF and RDFS have a [formal semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/) which means that what we can infer from a set of RDFS statements is not necessarily a matter of applying an \"if-then\" rule. RDFS reasoning is, however, [deductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) as opposed to [inductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Is it possible to use inductive reasoning e.g. Machine Learning and Deep Learning on RDF graphs as well?\n",
    "Yes! We teach some of these techniques in our Masters course at DKE on [Building and Mining Knowledge Graphs](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/meta/371276/building-and-mining-knowledge-graphs) which builds on many of the technologies we cover in this course such as RDF and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/)."
