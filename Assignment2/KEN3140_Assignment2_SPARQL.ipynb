    "# KEN 3140 Semantic Web: Assignment 2\n",
    "### Writing and executing SPARQL queries on RDF graphs\n",
    "#### Assignment task description\n",
    "Please read all sections of this document very carefully before attempting the assignment, asking questions and submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will assess your competencies with formulating SPARQL queries in order to answer a series of questions about the content of a pre-prepared RDF graph about family relations. The graph is provided in the file ``KEN3140_assignment2_familyrelations.ttl`` in Turtle syntax included along with your assignment materials. You will also observe the effect of RDFS inference when used in conjunction with SPARQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to this assignment: a **Part A** and a **Part B**. Both parts require you to formulate SPARQL queries to answer the questions asked in that part. Part A questions require less complex SPARQL queries and Part B requires more complex queries and potentially the use of advanced features of the SPARQL language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin formulating your queries, it might be helpful to explore the graph in some way. You are free to do this in whichever way you prefer. At the very least, you can open ``KEN3140_assignment2_familyrelations.ttl`` in the text editor of your choice and examine the triples. A picture of the graph is also available in the file ``KEN3140_assignment2_familyrelations.png`` which may help you to understand the structure and content of the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make note of the information in the provided graph as well as the vocabularies it uses i.e., which external vocabularies are used to specify the types, object properties and data properties in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learning objectives:\n",
    "1. How to formulate basic and complex SPARQL queries with valid structure and syntax\n",
    "2. How to identify and select the appropriate SPARQL features for including in a query, in order to answer a specific question\n",
    "3. How to design triple and graph patterns to match criteria that a question or task requires\n",
    "4. How to include new information in an RDF graph using SPARQL queries\n",
    "5. How to identify, select and include appropriate SPARQL functions in SPARQL queries to filter entities according to their literal values\n",
    "6. How to distinguish between asserted and inferred statements in RDF graphs using RDFS inference in conjunction with SPARQL queries\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Deadline & submission instructions\n",
    "The deadline for your assignment is **Sunday, 27 September 2020 at 23:59 [note the extended deadline]**. You should upload a copy of this notebook which is where you will record your solutions. Please rename the notebook to include your name and student ID. I.e., name the notebook to: ``KEN3140_assignment2_(your name)_(your studentID).ipynb``.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Grading criteria\n",
    "We will assess the design of your SPARQL queries on a number of criteria directly related to the learning objectives of the assignment. I.e., we will assess to what extent you have demonstrated that you have achieved or mastered the learning objectives in the formulation of your SPARQL queries. Please make sure to follow the assignment instructions carefully and meet all the requirements! We will provide a more detailed scheme of our grading process when we release the solution and grades for this assignment later in the course. You will receive a grade out of 10 points for this assignment.\n",
