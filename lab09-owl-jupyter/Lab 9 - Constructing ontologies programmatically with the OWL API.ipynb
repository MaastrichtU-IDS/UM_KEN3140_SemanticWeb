    "### Constructing ontologies with the OWL API\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** 29 September 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Kody Moodley\n",
    "\n",
    "**Affiliation:** Institute of Data Science, Maastricht University\n",

    "\n",
    "**Notebook description**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook to which allows one to programmatically construct ontologies using the [Java-based OWL API](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/wiki/Documentation) without requiring knowledge of the full OWL API. I have built a Java wrapper for the OWLAPI called [SimpleOWLAPI](https://github.com/kodymoodley/simpleowlapi). This wrapper allows you to make use of the most important features of the OWL API in a much more concise way than having to use the original API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background: please read this section carefully before beginning the lab**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab follows on from Lab 6, 7, and 8 in which you familiarised yourself with the intuitions behind constructing OWL ontologies, the expressivity, reasoning complexity and semantics that need to be taken into account when constructing an ontology, and how this can affect its accuracy or quality. So far, you have used [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/) for constructing ontologies. Protege is a well-known ontology editor and it also has a cloud-based, collaborative version - [WebProtege](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/). However, Protege is just one tool amongst a variety of Semantic Web tools, not only ontology editors, but also reasoners, web applications and frameworks that push the vision of the Semantic Web forward. This lab will ask you to construct an OWL ontology **programmatically** using the OWL API instead of using a graphical ontology editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why not just use a graphical ontology editor?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can! However, in practice, it is useful to be able to load an ontology, edit it and \"attach\" it to extracted RDF data all programmatically from a script or software library. This is so that we can perform queries, reasoning, and mining algorithms that form part of a complex chain of computational processes (i.e., a group of software services called a scientific workflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lab instructions** \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this lab is to construct an OWL ontology describing the familiar domain of family relations that we have been using throughout this course. In other words, build **your own** family relations ontology with OWL 2 DL axioms that **you** think should be in this ontology. You do not have to reproduce the same ontology that was used in Labs 6-8. However, you may reuse some terms from this ontology if you wish. You will find example ontology construction commands you will need in Sections 2-3 of this notebook. Make use of the reasoner **incrementally** after adding new axioms (especially complex ones such as role constraints axioms) to check if unexpected inferences or logical errors arise. Example commands of how to invoke the reasoner can be found in Section 3. Please build **your** ontology in Section 4 of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sections 1 - 3 of this notebook demonstrates in detail, through examples, how to use SimpleOWLAPI to build OWL 2 DL ontologies programmatically\n",
    "* Section 4 is where you will actually construct your own ontology using commands such as those in Sections 1 - 3\n",

You can find OntoGraf under Window>Tabs>OntoGraf in Protégé. However, WebVowel has a more visually appealing interface. There are other ontology visualisers available as well, for example, [OWLGrEd](http://owlgred.lumii.lv/online_visualization).
