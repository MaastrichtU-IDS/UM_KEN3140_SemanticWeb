    "[RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/) is a Java library for creating and manipulating [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) information. There is a documentation page [here](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/) to learn how to get started with RDF4J. To import this (and other) Java libraries in Jupyter notebooks, we can use one of two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [cell magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cell-magics) command %%loadFromPOM. Just below this command, we have to paste the XML maven dependency as you would in a [pom.xml](https://www.javatpoint.com/maven-pom-xml#:~:text=POM%20is%20an%20acronym%20for,file%2C%20then%20executes%20the%20goal.) file for a Java maven project. **NB:** this code has to be executed within **one** cell and there should not be any other code in this cell. To find maven dependencies for your desired libraries you can search for them on [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) or [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).\n",
    "2. If you are having problems with getting the cell magics option to work, download the full .jar file for RDF4J [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/rdf4j/eclipse-rdf4j-3.4.0-onejar.jar&mirror_id=1190). The file is also included as a download with your lab materials on Canvas. **Place this .jar file in the same directory as this notebook.**\n"
