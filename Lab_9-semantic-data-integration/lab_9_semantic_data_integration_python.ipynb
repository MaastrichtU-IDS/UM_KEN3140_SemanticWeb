    "**Notebook description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was described in Lecture 9, different ontologies, vocabularies and knowledge graphs often define similar information and terms. When we examine the semantics (meaning) of terms across different vocabularies, sometimes we find that two terms with completely different IRIs actually share similar or equivalent meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to query integrated RDF data that is described using different terms with semantically related meaning, across different ontologies, we sometimes have to **map** (explicitly define the semantic relationships) between these terms. In this lab you will have complete exercises to practically execute this task on some example RDF data and vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the rdflib library for this lab again."
