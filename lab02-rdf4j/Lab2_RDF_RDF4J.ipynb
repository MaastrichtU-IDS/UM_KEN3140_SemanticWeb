    "[RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/) is a Java library for creating and manipulating [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) information. There is a documentation page [here](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/) to learn how to get started with RDF4J. To import this (and other) Java libraries in Jupyter notebooks, we can use one of two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the [cell magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cell-magics) command ``%%loadFromPOM``. This command allows us to import Java libraries using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) dependencies as you would in a [pom.xml](https://www.javatpoint.com/maven-pom-xml#:~:text=POM%20is%20an%20acronym%20for,file%2C%20then%20executes%20the%20goal.) **NB:** this code has to be executed within **one** cell and there should not be any other code in this cell. To find other maven dependencies for your desired libraries you can search for them on [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) or [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).\n",
    "2. If you are having problems with getting the cell magics option to work, download the full .jar file for RDF4J [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/rdf4j/eclipse-rdf4j-3.4.0-onejar.jar&mirror_id=1190). The file is also included as a download with your lab materials on Canvas. **Place this .jar file in the same directory as this notebook.**\n",

[FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) is a community-maintained vocabulary about people and common relations and properties about them. Consult the [Javadoc](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/) to see what other built-in relations there might be. E.g. to see what other FOAF relations there are in RDF4J you can go [here](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/org/eclipse/rdf4j/model/vocabulary/FOAF.html) and for RDF [here](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/org/eclipse/rdf4j/model/vocabulary/RDF.html). Essentially, just replace the name of the .html file in the URL with whatever vocabularies (predefined in RDF4J) you want to view. To see a full list of these predefined vocabularies in RDF4J, see [here](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/org/eclipse/rdf4j/model/vocabulary/package-summary.html). **NB: you are not restricted to these vocabularies. These are just the ones predefined by default for convenience in RDF4J. You can also define your own or reuse some from external vocabularies such as Schema.org** In fact, we reuse the predicate [http://schema.org/instructor](http://schema.org/instructor) from Schema.org in this example:"
