    "+ In this lab, we will ask you to query the [DBpedia](https://dbpedia.org/) knowledge graph!\n",

DBpedia is similar in information content to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). \n",
    "+ **A word on data quality:** remember that DBpedia is crowd-sourced. This means that volunteers and members of the general public are permitted to add and maintain it's content. As a result, you may encounter inaccuracies / omissions in the content and inconsistencies in how the information is represented. Don't be alarmed by this, it is not critical that the content is accurate for the learning objectives of this lab.\n"

    "+ In this lab, we will use an alternative SPARQL query interface to query DBPedia. It is called **[YASGUI](https://yasgui.triply.cc)**. The reason is that YASGUI has additional user-friendly features e.g. management of multiple SPARQL queries in separate tabs. It also allows one to query any publicly available SPARQL endpoint from the same interface."
